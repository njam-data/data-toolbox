NJAM Data Toolbox 
=================

A newsroom repository for navigating data sources, learning new tools and skills and accessing those tools. Designed for both reporters looking to learn and unorganized data reporters like me.

Live Link: <a href="http://sstirling.github.io/data-toolbox/build/index.html">NJ Advance Media Data Portal</a>

Static web pages built using Python, based on Ben Welsh's <a href="http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">First News App course at NICAR 2015.</a>  Special thanks to Jeremy Bowers and Derek Willis for helping me learn up on this.

Tables in main page and detail pages populated with Python, styled with DataTables.JS

Table on Tutorials page scraped from <a href="http://blog.chryswu.com/">Chrys Wu's wonderful blog,</a> and contains all listed tutorials and presentations from NICAR 2013 to NICAR 2015. Turned into HTML table using Tableizer! and styled using DataTables.JS

From this data portal template reporters in the newsroom can: 

&bull; Submit a data request to the project management system or ask a question<br>
&bull; Get raw data <br>
&bull; Find tools to get, clean, analyze and visualize data<br>
&bull; Access nearly 600 NICAR tutorials and presentations through a searchable database<br>
