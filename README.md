NJAM Data Toolbox 
=================

A newsroom repository for navigating data sources, learning new tools and skills and accessing those tools. Designed for both reporters looking to learn and unorganized data reporters like me.

Static web pages built using Python, based on Ben Welsh's <a href="http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">First News App course at NICAR 2015.</a>  

Tables in main page and detail pages populated with Python, styled with DataTables.JS

Table on Tutorials page scraped from <a href="http://blog.chryswu.com/">Chrys Wu's wonderful blog,</a> and contains all listed tutorials and presentations from NICAR 2013 to NICAR 2015. Turned into HTML table using Tableizer! and styled using DataTables.JS
